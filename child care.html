<p><h3>The All Kids program offers many Illinois children comprehensive healthcare that includes doctors visits, hospital stays, prescription drugs, vision care, dental care and medical devices like eyeglasses and asthma inhalers. Some families pay monthly premiums for the coverage, but rates for middle-income families are significantly lower than they are on the private market. For instance, a family of four that earns between $51,432 and $78,228 a year pays a $40 monthly premium per child, and a $10 co-pay per physician visit.  Fill out the application today.</h3>
